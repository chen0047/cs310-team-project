# cs310-team-project 
# Adjust Readme. file to complete the CS304 Assignment
This is the team project that we has worked in the class CS310 during the Spring Semester of 2019. Based on the idea of Scrum, I contributed as a developer in the team, and it was total of 8 features; however, we were allowed to complete as much as possible in the rest of time periods. Among different classes in the feature 1, I chose to work on the database from JQuery, and it was quite challenge since we had to start from scratches. Also, I continued to contribute mainly in TASdatabase in the feature 2, 5, 6, and 7. Feature 2, I worked on the ArrayList that looping through the PunchList. Feature 5, I worked on the getPunchList As JSON; feature 6, I helped to complete the Absenteeism; at last, on feature 7, I helped to complete the calculateTotalMinutes. Even though we did not complete all the features, we still considered it was interesting and depressive experiences overall, respectively.
